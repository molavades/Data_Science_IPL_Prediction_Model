## Overview  
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict match outcomes in the **Indian Premier League (IPL)**. Using historical IPL data, the project analyzes team performance, player contributions, and match dynamics to build a predictive model. The project also provides visual insights through data visualizations.

---

## Objectives  
- Perform in-depth analysis of IPL match data to identify patterns and trends.  
- Build a predictive machine learning model to forecast match outcomes.  
- Visualize team performance, toss impacts, and player statistics.

---

## Data Sources  
The datasets used in this project include:  
1. **`Matches.csv`**: Match-level data including teams, toss decisions, results, and venues.  
2. **`Deliveries.csv`**: Ball-by-ball data with detailed information about player performances.  

---

## Project Components  

1. **Data Analysis**  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of both `Matches.csv` and `Deliveries.csv`.  
   - Analysis of toss decisions, match-winning factors, and team performance over the years.  

2. **Machine Learning Model**  
   - Features: Team performance metrics, toss decisions, and venue details.  
   - Algorithms tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.  
   - Final model achieves high accuracy based on evaluation metrics.

3. **Visualization Insights**  
   - Win rates of IPL teams across seasons.  
   - Toss impact on match outcomes.  
   - Top-performing players based on runs scored and wickets taken.

4. **Notebook**: `IPL Prediction Model.ipynb`  
   - Includes the complete workflow: data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
